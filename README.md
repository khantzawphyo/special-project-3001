# Scheduling Exam Timetable using CSP Solutions

## Overview

The project aims to create an exam schedule using Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) solutions that accommodates the needs of all stakeholders. This schedule will address constraints such as:

- Allowing invigilators teaching a subject to be exempt from waiting for the exam room except the requested.
- Ensuring that each invigilator spends time in the exam room at least once a day as soon as possible.
- Guaranteeing that each student can only take one exam per day.

By using **CSP solutions**, this project aims to efficiently and effectively develop a timetable that meets the requirements of all parties involved in the examination process.
